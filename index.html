            <h2>Brazil: my feelings</h2>
            <p>Brazil is imposing, it is full of life, full of kind and smiling people, of course there are also several problems and one of them is the poor administration of the country. But here we will get to know a little more about the geography of this country, the population, and so many factors that make this country, in my point of view, a giant.</p>

          <h2>Learning about Brazil</h2>
            <p>Brazil is the largest country in South America, with an area of over 8.5 million km². Its capital is the city of Brasilia. It presents a great climatic and landscape variety, which can be analyzed through the morphoclimatic domains.
            <br>
            The Brazilian population will reach 213,317,639 inhabitants in 2021, according to the IBGE, with more than 87% of them living in cities. São Paulo, capital of the state of the same name, constitutes the largest urban area in Brazil, with 12 million inhabitants.
            <br>            
            The Brazilian economy, although led by the tertiary sector, also stands out in areas such as the petrochemical and automobile industries, and in agricultural production, with soybeans as its flagship crop.
