          <h2>Geography</h2>
          <p>As said before, Brazil is considered a country of continental dimensions, as it has a large territorial area, totaling 8,514,976 km², which makes it the fifth largest country in existence, behind Russia, Canada, China and the United States. By way of comparison, the area of Europe (minus Russia) is approximately 6,220,000 km².</p>
          <p>Brazil is located in South America, and is also part of the Latin American countries. Overall, the national territory is located in three different hemispheres: west, a small part in the north and most of it in the south. It borders all South American countries, with the exception of Chile and Ecuador.</p>
          <p>The fact that the country is crossed by the Tropic of Capricorn and the Equator - which highlights the latitude variations - is responsible for a wide climatic diversity and, consequently, in its vegetation. Brazil is also home to the forest with the greatest diversity in the world: the Amazon.</p>
          <p>To understand the Brazilian landscapes and the territorial dynamics of Brazil, it is necessary to study and analyze the the natural phenomena of the Brazilian space, in their characteristics as well as in their relations of interdependence.</p>
          <p>Therefore, the Physical Geography of Brazil aims to study and enumerate descriptive and analytical understandings of the natural elements of the Brazilian territory, operating from four distinct fields of study, namely: the lithosphere, the atmosphere, the hydrosphere and the biosphere. It is clear that the interrelations between these elements are of fundamental importance.</p>

          <h3>Lithosphere</h3>
          <p>The lithosphere, that is, the structural dynamics of the Brazilian relief, reveals the geologically ancient character of the rock formations in Brazil. Thus, one can see that the geographic space in the country has been much modified over the ages by external or exogenous agents of relief transformation. 
            This factor, added to the country's location inside the South American tectonic plate, has contributed to the absence of high altitudes in the country.</p>
          <p>The highest point in Brazil is Pico da Neblina, located in the North region, almost at the border with Venezuela. The most predominant types of relief are plateaus and plains, in addition to the relative depressions observed in some areas, as is the case in the northeastern sertão. The geological structures present are the cratons and the sedimentary basins, where in the latter there is oil along the country's coast.</p>

          <h3>Hidrosphere</h3>
          <p>The Brazilian hydrosphere stands out for its abundant water resources. The country has the largest river in the world in volume, the Amazon, which is the main water course of the Amazon Basin, one of the most extensive hydrographic basins on the planet. Besides the plain rivers, favorable for navigation, there are the plateau rivers, more rugged and favorable for the production of hydroelectricity, the main energy matrix in Brazil.</p>

          <h3>Atmosphere</h3>
          <p>The atmosphere is related to the climates of Brazil. Due to the fact that the country is almost entirely located in an intertropical zone, with most of the territory positioned north of the Tropic of Cancer and south of the Equator, the Brazilian climate presents relative variations, being predominantly hot. According to the climatic classification of A. Sthahler, the Brazilian climates are: humid equatorial, tropical alternately humid and dry, tropical tending to dry, humid coastal and humid subtropical.</p>

        <h3>Biosphere</h3>
          <p>Brazil's biosphere presents a wide diversity, with large morphoclimatic domains and distinct types of biomes. One can also note the high degree of devastation of the Atlantic Forest and Cerrado, as well as several natural areas in the South region.</p> 
            <p>The biomes of Brazil are:</p> 
              <ul>
                <li>Amazon</li>
                <li>Caatinga</li>
                <li>Cerrado</li>
                <li>Atlantic Forest</li>
                <li>Pantanal</li>
                <li>Pampa</li>
              </ul>
